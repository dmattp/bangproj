h1. BangSh, a simple shell for Bang!

BangSh provides a simple curses based interface for working with a "Bang! interpreter":https://github.com/dmattp/bang.  Bang code can be entered at a command prompt and the stack results will be displayed by BangSh.

Line editing supports typical emacs keybindings (M-b backward word, M-f forward word, M-d delete word, C-a beg of line, C-e end of line etc&).

BangSh is written mostly in Bang! and requires "Nylon for Bang!":https://github.com/dmattp/bangproj/tree/master/bangnylon and "curses for Bang!":https://github.com/dmattp/bangproj/tree/master/curses.  For a windows environment, the "Bang! powershell bindings":https://github.com/dmattp/bangproj/tree/master/psbind provide access to a good mess of system functionality within the Bang! environment.
