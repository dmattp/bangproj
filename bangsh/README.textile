h1. BangSh, a simple shell like environment for working with Bang! language

BangSh provides a simple curses based interface for working with
a "Bang! interpreter":https://github.com/dmattp/bang.  Bang code can be entered at a command prompt and
the stack results will be displayed by BangSh.

Line editing supports typical emacs keybindings (M-b backward word, M-f forward word, M-d delete word,
C-a beg of line, C-e end of line etc&).

BangSh is written mostly in Bang! and requires "Nylon for Bang!":https://github.com/dmattp/bangproj/bangnylon
and "curses for Bang!":https://github.com/dmattp/bangproj/curses.  For a windows environment, the
"Bang! powershell bindings":https://github.com/dmattp/bangproj/psbind provide access to a good mess of
system functionality within the Bang! environment.
